# Share Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds WhatsApp and Facebook sharing capabilities to the AiCarAdvisor application, allowing users to share car comparison pages and car details. The component now includes a dropdown menu with options for WhatsApp, Facebook, and copy link functionality.

## Components Added

### ShareButtons Component
Location: `src/components/common/ShareButtons.tsx`

A reusable component that provides:
- WhatsApp sharing
- Facebook sharing
- Copy link to clipboard
- Customizable title and description
- Multiple size variants (small, medium, large)
- Three display variants (icon, button, dropdown)

## Features

### WhatsApp Sharing
- Uses the `https://wa.me/?text=` API
- Automatically formats the message with title, description, and URL
- Creates rich link previews with images using Open Graph meta tags from the shared URL
- Opens in a new tab/window

### Facebook Sharing
- Uses the Facebook Share Dialog API
- Shares the current page URL
- Automatically displays rich link previews with images using Open Graph meta tags
- Opens in a new tab/window

### Rich Link Previews with Images
- When sharing URLs, platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook automatically create rich previews
- These previews include the image specified in the Open Graph meta tags
- The image is automatically pulled from the website's Open Graph meta tags
- No need to manually specify image URLs - the platform handles it automatically

### How Rich Link Previews Work
- **WhatsApp/Facebook**: Automatically fetch Open Graph meta tags from the shared URL
- **Open Graph tags**: Include title, description, and image information
- **Result**: Beautiful card-style previews with images appear automatically
- **No manual image handling**: The platforms do all the work for you

### Copy Link
- Copies the current page URL to clipboard
- Shows success notification when copied
- Fallback support for older browsers
- Automatically closes dropdown after copying

### URL Handling
- Automatically detects the current page URL if no custom URL is provided
- Supports custom URLs for specific sharing scenarios

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import ShareButtons from '@/components/common/ShareButtons';

<ShareButtons />
```

## Testing
To test the share functionality:
1. Navigate to any car comparison page
2. Look for the share button after the Compare button
3. Click on the share button to open the dropdown
4. Test each option:
   - WhatsApp: Should open WhatsApp share dialog
   - Facebook: Should open Facebook share dialog
   - Copy Link: Should copy URL and show success message
5. Verify that the dropdown closes after each action
6. Test on both mobile and desktop devices

## Migration from Previous Version
If you were using the old `icon` variant, simply change to `variant="dropdown"`:
```tsx
// Old
<ShareButtons variant="icon" />

// New (recommended)
<ShareButtons variant="dropdown" />
```

The dropdown variant provides the same functionality in a more space-efficient and user-friendly design.
